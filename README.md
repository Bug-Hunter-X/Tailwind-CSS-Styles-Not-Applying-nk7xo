# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common but sometimes elusive issue in Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied despite seemingly correct configuration.  The `bug.css` file shows the initial setup that failed to work, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version that addresses the potential causes.

The problem often lies in simple configuration errors, typos in class names, or conflicts with other CSS rules.  This example highlights the most common pitfalls and how to fix them.  Please refer to the files for a detailed breakdown.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Incorrect import or configuration:**  Incorrect paths to your Tailwind CSS configuration, missing or incorrect `@tailwind` directives, or issues with your build process.
* **CSS specificity:** Existing stylesheets might be overriding Tailwind's rules.  Examine your `style.css` file to ensure no conflicts.
* **Typographical errors:** A small typo in a class name can prevent it from being applied.  Pay close attention to the correct casing and spelling.
* **Caching Issues:**  Though a clean build is usually sufficient, there could be lingering cache issues within your browser or build tools.  Try clearing your browser cache or using different build tools.
